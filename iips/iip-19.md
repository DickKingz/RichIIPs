## Simple Summary
Illuvium Flash Pool is a great tool for marketing and onboarding new players from strong communities. Newly launched ApeCoin is a great target for such marketing.

## Abstract 
Unpause flash pool launches and offer BAYC/MAYC NFT holders to stake their ApeCoin in the Illuvium flashpool.

## Overview
There are currently 39,778 holders of ApeCoin. Illuvium flash pool can be used to target these holders and allow them to stake their tokens, thus introducing them to 
Illuvium game.
 
## Rationale
Substantial progress was made in developing Illuvium since the last time flash pool was used. Launch of Staking V2 and upcoming Land Sale, Private Beta and 
upcoming Public Beta are the major events happening now. By allowing BAYC/MAYC NFT holders to stake their ApeCoin, we will greatly increase the visibility into
these events and bring new customers. ApeCoin hoders are currenly waiting for native staking, which will take anywhere from 16 to 20 weeks. Creating flash pool for
them in the meantime will greatly increase the hype and anticipation rigth before the launch of Land Sale and Public Beta, which in turn will increase the amount
paying customers and land owners.
